The purpose of this assessment is for you to combine your skills of creating, writing, documenting, and testing an R package with releasing that package on GitHub. In this assessment you'll be taking the R files from Week 2's assessment about documentation and putting that file in an R package. 

For this assessment you must

 - write a vignette to include in your package using knitr and R Markdown
 - write at least one test written using testthat
 - put your package on GitHub
 - set up the repository so that the package can be checked and built on Travis
 - Once your package has built on Travis and the build is passing with no errors, warnings, or -  - notes you should add your Travis badge to the README.md file of your package repository.

```{r setup}
library(devtools)
library(testthat)
use_vignette("Details")
```
